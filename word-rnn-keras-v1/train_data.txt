health insurance is insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses spreading the risk over a large number of persons by estimating the overall risk of health care and health system expenses over the risk pool an insurer can develop a routine finance structure such as a monthly premium or payroll tax to provide the money to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement the benefit is administered by a central organization such as a government agency private business or notforprofit entity according to the health insurance association of america health insurance is defined as coverage that provides for the payments of benefits as a result of sickness or injury it includes insurance for losses from accident medical expense disability or accidental death and dismemberment p 225 background a health insurance policy isa contract between an insurance provider eg an insurance company or a government and an individual or hisher sponsor eg an employer or a community organization the contract can be renewable eg annually monthly or lifelong in the case of private insurance or be mandatory for all citizens in the case of national plans the
type and amount of health care costs that will be covered by the health insurance provider are specified in writing in a member contract or evidence of coverage booklet for private insurance or in a national health policy for public insuranceus specific provided by an employersponsored selffunded erisa plan the company generally advertises that they have one of the big insurance companies however in an erisa case that insurance company doesnt engage in the act of insurance they just administer it therefore erisa plans are not subject to state laws erisa plans are governed by federal law under the jurisdiction of the us department of labor usdol the specific benefits or coverage details are found in the summary plan description spd an appeal must go through the insurance company then to the employers plan fiduciary if still required the fiduciarys decision can be brought to the usdol to review for erisa compliance and then file a lawsuit in federal courtthe individual insured persons obligations may take several forms premium the amount the policyholder or their sponsor eg an employer pays to the health plan to purchase health coveragedeductible the amount that the insured must pay outofpocket before the health insurer
pays its share for example policyholders might have to pay a 500 deductible per year before any of their health care is covered by the health insurer it may take several doctors visits or prescription refills before the insured person reaches the deductible and the insurance company starts to pay for care furthermore most policies do not apply copays for doctors visits or prescriptions against your deductiblecopayment the amount that the insured person must pay out of pocket before the health insurer pays for a particular visit or service for example an insured person might pay a 45 copayment for a doctors visit or to obtain a prescription a copayment must be paid each time a particular service is obtainedcoinsurance instead of or in addition to paying a fixed amount up front a copayment the coinsurance is a percentage of the total cost that insured person may also pay for example the member might have to pay 20 of the cost of a surgery over and above a copayment while the insurance company pays the other 80 if there is an upper limit on coinsurance the policyholder could end up owing very little or a great deal depending on the
actual costs of the services they obtainexclusions not all services are covered billed items like useandthrow taxes etc are excluded from admissible claim the insured are generally expected to pay the full cost of noncovered services out of their own pocketscoverage limits some health insurance policies only pay for health care up to a certain dollar amount the insured person may be expected to pay any charges in excess of the health plans maximum payment for a specific service in addition some insurance company schemes have annual or lifetime coverage maxima in these cases the health plan will stop payment when they reach the benefit maximum and the policyholder must pay all remaining costsoutofpocket maxima similar to coverage limits except that in this case the insured persons payment obligation ends when they reach the outofpocket maximum and health insurance pays all further covered costs outofpocket maxima can be limited to a specific benefit category such as prescription drugs or can apply to all coverage provided during a specific benefit yearcapitation an amount paid by an insurer to a health care provider for which the provider agrees to treat all members of the insurerinnetwork provider us term a health care provider

part of the public health insurance plan but may be purchased and administered either through private or group plans or through the public plansome if not most health care providers in the united states will agree to bill the insurance company if patients are willing to sign an agreement that they will be responsible for the amount that the insurance company doesnt pay the insurance company pays out of network providers according to reasonable and customary charges which may be less than the providers usual fee the provider may also have a separate contract with the insurer to accept what amounts to a discounted rate or capitation to the providers standard charges it generally costs the patient less to use an innetwork provider comparisons the commonwealth fund in its annual survey mirror mirror on the wall compares the performance of the health care systems in australia new zealand the united kingdom germany canada and the us its 2007 study found that although the us system is the most expensive it consistently underperforms compared to the other countries one difference between the us and the other countries in the study is that the us is the only country without universal health
insurance coveragethe commonwealth fund completed its thirteenth annual health policy survey in 2010 a study of the survey found significant differences in access cost burdens and problems with health insurance that are associated with insurance design of the countries surveyed the results indicated that people in the united states had more outofpocket expenses more disputes with insurance companies than other countries and more insurance payments denied paperwork was also higher although germany had similarly high levels of paperwork australia the australian public health system is called medicare which provides free universal access to hospital treatment and subsidised outofhospital medical treatment it is funded by a 2 tax levy on all taxpayers an extra 1 levy on high income earners as well as general revenuethe private health system is funded by a number of private health insurance organizations the largest of these is medibank private limited which was until 2014 a governmentowned entity when it was privatized and listed on the australian stock exchangeaustralian health funds can be either for profit including bupa and nib mutual including australian unity or nonprofit including gmhba hcf and the hbf health fund hbf some such as police health have membership restricted to particular groups

impose a waiting period of up to 12 months on benefits for any medical condition the signs and symptoms of which existed during the six months ending on the day the person first took out insurance they are also entitled to impose a 12month waiting period for benefits for treatment relating to an obstetric condition and a 2month waiting period for all other benefits when a person first takes out private insurance funds have the discretion to reduce or remove such waiting periods in individual cases they are also free not to impose them to begin with but this would place such a fund at risk of adverse selection attracting a disproportionate number of members from other funds or from the pool of intending members who might otherwise have joined other funds it would also attract people with existing medical conditions who might not otherwise have taken out insurance at all because of the denial of benefits for 12 months due to the pea rule the benefits paid out for these conditions would create pressure on premiums for all the funds members causing some to drop their membership which would lead to further rises in premiums and a vicious cycle
of higher premiumsleaving members would ensuethe australian government has introduced a number of incentives to encourage adults to take out private hospital insurance these includelifetime health cover if a person has not taken out private hospital cover by 1 july after their 31st birthday then when and if they do so after this time their premiums must include a loading of 2 per annum for each year they were without hospital cover thus a person taking out private cover for the first time at age 40 will pay a 20 percent loading the loading is removed after 10 years of continuous hospital cover the loading applies only to premiums for hospital cover not to ancillary extras covermedicare levy surcharge people whose taxable income is greater than a specified amount in the 201112 financial year 80000 for singles and 168000 for couples and who do not have an adequate level of private hospital cover must pay a 1 surcharge on top of the standard 15 medicare levy the rationale is that if the people in this income group are forced to pay more money one way or another most would choose to purchase hospital insurance with it with the possibility of
a benefit in the event that they need private hospital treatment  rather than pay it in the form of extra tax as well as having to meet their own private hospital coststhe australian government announced in may 2008 that it proposes to increase the thresholds to 100000 for singles and 150000 for families these changes require legislative approval a bill to change the law has been introduced but was not passed by the senate an amended version was passed on 16 october 2008 there have been criticisms that the changes will cause many people to drop their private health insurance causing a further burden on the public hospital system and a rise in premiums for those who stay with the private system other commentators believe the effect will be minimalprivate health insurance rebate the government subsidises the premiums for all private health insurance cover including hospital and ancillary extras by 10 20 or 30 depending on age the rudd government announced in may 2009 that as of july 2010 the rebate would become meanstested and offered on a sliding scale while this move which would have required legislation was defeated in the senate at the time in early 2011
the gillard government announced plans to reintroduce the legislation after the opposition loses the balance of power in the senate the alp and greens have long been against the rebate referring to it as middleclass welfare canada health care is mainly a constitutional provincial government responsibility in canada the main exceptions being federal government responsibility for services provided to aboriginal peoples covered by treaties the royal canadian mounted police the armed forces and members of parliament consequently each province administers its own health insurance program the federal government influences health insurance by virtue of its fiscal powers  it transfers cash and tax points to the provinces to help cover the costs of the universal health insurance programs under the canada health act the federal government mandates and enforces the requirement that all people have free access to what are termed medically necessary services defined primarily as care delivered by physicians or in hospitals and the nursing component of long term residential care if provinces allow doctors or institutions to charge patients for medically necessary services the federal government reduces its payments to the provinces by the amount of the prohibited charges collectively the public provincial health insurance systems in
canada are frequently referred to as medicare this public insurance is taxfunded out of general government revenues although british columbia and ontario levy a mandatory premium with flat rates for individuals and families to generate additional revenues  in essence a surtax private health insurance is allowed but in six provincial governments only for services that the public health plans do not cover for example semiprivate or private rooms in hospitals and prescription drug plans four provinces allow insurance for services also mandated by the canada health act but in practice there is no market for it all canadians are free to use private insurance for elective medical services such as laser vision correction surgery cosmetic surgery and other nonbasic medical procedures some 65 of canadians have some form of supplementary private health insurance many of them receive it through their employers privatesector services not paid for by the government account for nearly 30 percent of total health care spendingin 2005 the supreme court of canada ruled in chaoulli v quebec that the provinces prohibition on private insurance for health care already insured by the provincial plan violated the quebec charter of rights and freedoms and in particular the sections
dealing with the right to life and security if there were unacceptably long wait times for treatment as was alleged in this case the ruling has not changed the overall pattern of health insurance across canada but has spurred on attempts to tackle the core issues of supply and demand and the impact of wait times china  france the national system of health insurance was instituted in 1945 just after the end of the second world war it was a compromise between gaullist and communist representatives in the french parliament the conservative gaullists were opposed to a staterun healthcare system while the communists were supportive of a complete nationalisation of health care along a british beveridge modelthe resulting programme is professionbased all people working are required to pay a portion of their income to a notforprofit health insurance fund which mutualises the risk of illness and which reimburses medical expenses at varying rates children and spouses of insured people are eligible for benefits as well each fund is free to manage its own budget and used to reimburse medical expenses at the rate it saw fit however following a number of reforms in recent years the majority of funds
provide the same level of reimbursement and benefitsthe government has two responsibilities in this systemthe first government responsibility is the fixing of the rate at which medical expenses should be negotiated and it does so in two ways the ministry of health directly negotiates prices of medicine with the manufacturers based on the average price of sale observed in neighboring countries a board of doctors and experts decides if the medicine provides a valuable enough medical benefit to be reimbursed note that most medicine is reimbursed including homeopathy in parallel the government fixes the reimbursement rate for medical services this means that a doctor is free to charge the fee that he wishes for a consultation or an examination but the social security system will only reimburse it at a preset rate these tariffs are set annually through negotiation with doctors representative organisationsthe second government responsibility is oversight of the healthinsurance funds to ensure that they are correctly managing the sums they receive and to ensure oversight of the public hospital networktoday this system is more or less intact all citizens and legal foreign residents of france are covered by one of these mandatory programs which continue to be funded
by worker participation however since 1945 a number of major changes have been introduced firstly the different health care funds there are five general independent agricultural student public servants now all reimburse at the same rate secondly since 2000 the government now provides health care to those who are not covered by a mandatory regime those who have never worked and who are not students meaning the very rich or the very poor this regime unlike the workerfinanced ones is financed via general taxation and reimburses at a higher rate than the professionbased system for those who cannot afford to make up the difference finally to counter the rise in health care costs the government has installed two plans in 2004 and 2006 which require insured people to declare a referring doctor in order to be fully reimbursed for specialist visits and which installed a mandatory copay of 1  about 145 for a doctor visit 050  about 80 for each box of medicine prescribed and a fee of 1618  2025 per day for hospital stays and for expensive proceduresan important element of the french insurance system is solidarity the more ill a person becomes the less the
person pays this means that for people with serious or chronic illnesses the insurance system reimburses them 100 of expenses and waives their copay chargesfinally for fees that the mandatory system does not cover there is a large range of private complementary insurance plans available the market for these programs is very competitive and often subsidised by the employer which means that premiums are usually modest 85 of french people benefit from complementary private health insurance germany germany has the worlds oldest national social health insurance system with origins dating back to otto von bismarcks sickness insurance law of 1883currently 85 of the population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute which provides a standard level of coverage the remainder opt for private health insurance which frequently offers additional benefits according to the world health organization germanys health care system was 77 governmentfunded and 23 privately funded as of 2004the government partially reimburses the costs for lowwage workers whose premiums are capped at a predetermined value higher wage workers pay a premium based on their salary they may also opt for private insurance which is generally more expensive but whose price may vary based on the
individuals health statusreimbursement is on a feeforservice basis but the number of physicians allowed to accept statutory health insurance in a given locale is regulated by the government and professional societiesco payments were introduced in the 1980s in an attempt to prevent over utilization the average length of hospital stay in germany has decreased in recent years from 14 days to 9 days still considerably longer than average stays in the united states 5 to 6 days part of the difference is that the chief consideration for hospital reimbursement is the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or diagnosis drug costs have increased substantially rising nearly 60 from 1991 through 2005 despite attempts to contain costs overall health care expenditures rose to 107 of gdp in 2005 comparable to other western european nations but substantially less than that spent in the us nearly 16 of gdp insurance systems germans are offered three kinds of social security insurance dealing with the physical status of a person and which are cofinanced by employer and employee health insurance accident insurance and longterm care insurancegermany has a universal multipayer system with two main types of health insurance law enforced health insurance or

equalization pool moral hazard is avoided by mandating that insurance companies provide at least one policy which meets a government set minimum standard level of coverage and all adult residents are obliged by law to purchase this coverage from an insurance company of their choice all insurance companies receive funds from the equalization pool to help cover the cost of this governmentmandated coverage this pool is run by a regulator which collects salarybased contributions from employers which make up about 50 of all health care funding and funding from the government to cover people who cannot afford health care which makes up an additional 5the remaining 45 of health care funding comes from insurance premiums paid by the public for which companies compete on price though the variation between the various competing insurers is only about 5 however insurance companies are free to sell additional policies to provide coverage beyond the national minimum these policies do not receive funding from the equalization pool but cover additional treatments such as dental procedures and physiotherapy which are not paid for by the mandatory policyfunding from the equalization pool is distributed to insurance companies for each person they insure under the required policy
however highrisk individuals get more from the pool and lowincome persons and children under 18 have their insurance paid for entirely because of this insurance companies no longer find insuring high risk individuals an unappealing proposition avoiding the potential problem of adverse selectioninsurance companies are not allowed to have copayments caps or deductibles or to deny coverage to any person applying for a policy or to charge anything other than their nationally set and published standard premiums therefore every person buying insurance will pay the same price as everyone else buying the same policy and every person will get at least the minimum level of coverage new zealand since 1974 new zealand has had a system of universal nofault health insurance for personal injuries through the accident compensation corporation acc the acc scheme covers most of the costs of related to treatment of injuries acquired in new zealand including overseas visitors regardless of how the injury occurred and also covers lost income at 80 percent of the employees preinjury income and costs related to longterm rehabilitation such as home and vehicle modifications for those seriously injured funding from the scheme comes from a combination of levies on employers payroll for
work injuries levies on an employees taxable income for nonwork injuries to salary earners levies on vehicle licensing fees and petrol for motor vehicle accidents and funds from the general taxation pool for nonwork injuries to children senior citizens unemployed people overseas visitors etc rwanda rwanda is one of a handful of low income countries that has implemented communitybased health insurance schemes in order to reduce the financial barriers that prevent poor people from seeking and receiving needed health services this scheme has helped reach 90 of the countrys population with health care coverage switzerland healthcare in switzerland is universal and is regulated by the swiss federal law on health insurance health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in switzerland within three months of taking up residence or being born in the country it is therefore the same throughout the country and avoids double standards in healthcare insurers are required to offer this basic insurance to everyone regardless of age or medical condition they are not allowed to make a profit off this basic insurance but can on supplemental plansthe universal compulsory coverage provides for treatment in case of illness or accident and pregnancy health insurance covers the costs

this the government gives the insured person a cash subsidy to pay for any additional premiumthe compulsory insurance can be supplemented by private complementary insurance policies that allow for coverage of some of the treatment categories not covered by the basic insurance or to improve the standard of room and service in case of hospitalisation this can include complementary medicine routine dental treatment and private ward hospitalisation which are not covered by the compulsory insuranceas far as the compulsory health insurance is concerned the insurance companies cannot set any conditions relating to age sex or state of health for coverage although the level of premium can vary from one company to another they must be identical within the same company for all insured persons of the same age group and region regardless of sex or state of health this does not apply to complementary insurance where premiums are riskbasedswitzerland has an infant mortality rate of about 36 out of 1000 the general life expectancy in 2012 was for men 805 years compared to 847 years for women these are the worlds best figures united kingdom the uks national health service nhs is a publicly funded healthcare system that provides coverage
to everyone normally resident in the uk it is not strictly an insurance system because a there are no premiums collected b costs are not charged at the patient level and c costs are not prepaid from a pool however it does achieve the main aim of insurance which is to spread financial risk arising from illhealth the costs of running the nhs est 104 billion in 20078 are met directly from general taxation the nhs provides the majority of health care in the uk including primary care inpatient care longterm health care ophthalmology and dentistryprivate health care has continued parallel to the nhs paid for largely by private insurance but it is used by less than 8 of the population and generally as a topup to nhs services there are many treatments that the private sector does not provide for example health insurance on pregnancy is generally not covered or covered with restricting clauses typical exclusions for bupa schemes and many other insurers includeageing menopause and puberty aidshiv allergies or allergic disorders birth control conception sexual problems and sex changes chronic conditions complications from excluded or restricted conditions treatment convalescence rehabilitation and general nursing care  cosmetic reconstructive or

any gap between the funding provided by their insurance company and the cost of their chosen private treatment it went in to call on the bma to publicise these concerns so that patients are fully informed when making choices about private healthcare insurance the practice of insurance companies deciding which consultant a patient may see as opposed to gps or patients is referred to as open referral the nhs offers patients a choice of hospitals and consultants and does not charge for its servicesthe private sector has been used to increase nhs capacity despite a large proportion of the british public opposing such involvement according to the world health organization government funding covered 86 of overall health care expenditures in the uk as of 2004 with private expenditures covering the remaining 14nearly one in three patients receiving nhs hospital treatment is privately insured and could have the cost paid for by their insurer some private schemes provide cash payments to patients who opt for nhs treatment to deter use of private facilities a report by private health analysts laing and buisson in november 2012 estimated that more than 250000 operations were performed on patients with private medical insurance each year
at a cost of 359 million in addition 609 million was spent on emergency medical or surgical treatment private medical insurance does not normally cover emergency treatment but subsequent recovery could be paid for if the patient were moved into a private patient unit united states the united states health care system relies heavily on private health insurance which is the primary source of coverage for most americans as of 2012 about 61 of americans had private health insurance according to the centers for disease control and prevention the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq found that in 2011 private insurance was billed for 122 million us inpatient hospital stays and incurred approximately 1125 billion in aggregate inpatient hospital costs 29 of the total national aggregate costs public programs provide the primary source of coverage for most senior citizens and for lowincome children and families who meet certain eligibility requirements the primary public programs are medicare a federal social insurance program for seniors and certain disabled individuals and medicaid funded jointly by the federal government and states but administered at the state level which covers certain very low income children and their families together medicare and medicaid accounted for
approximately 63 percent of the national inpatient hospital costs in 2011 schip is a federalstate partnership that serves certain children and families who do not qualify for medicaid but who cannot afford private coverage other public programs include military health benefits provided through tricare and the veterans health administration and benefits provided through the indian health service some states have additional programs for lowincome individualsin the late 1990s and early 2000s health advocacy companies began to appear to help patients deal with the complexities of the healthcare system the complexity of the healthcare system has resulted in a variety of problems for the american public a study found that 62 percent of persons declaring bankruptcy in 2007 had unpaid medical expenses of 1000 or more and in 92 of these cases the medical debts exceeded 5000 nearly 80 percent who filed for bankruptcy had health insurance the medicare and medicaid programs were estimated to soon account for 50 percent of all national health spending these factors and many others fueled interest in an overhaul of the health care system in the united states in 2010 president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act this act includes
an individual mandate that every american must have medical insurance or pay a fine health policy experts such as david cutler and jonathan gruber as well as the american medical insurance lobby group americas health insurance plans argued this provision was required in order to provide guaranteed issue and a community rating which address unpopular features of americas health insurance system such as premium weightings exclusions for preexisting conditions and the prescreening of insurance applicants during 2628 march the supreme court heard arguments regarding the validity of the act the patient protection and affordable care act was determined to be constitutional on 28 june 2012 scotus determined that congress had the authority to apply the individual mandate within its taxing powers history and evolution in the late 19th century accident insurance began to be available which operated much like modern disability insurance this payment model continued until the start of the 20th century in some jurisdictions like california where all laws regulating health insurance actually referred to disability insuranceaccident insurance was first offered in the united states by the franklin health assurance company of massachusetts this firm founded in 1850 offered insurance against injuries arising from railroad and steamboat accidents
sixty organizations were offering accident insurance in the us by 1866 but the industry consolidated rapidly soon thereafter while there were earlier experiments the origins of sickness coverage in the us effectively date from 1890 the first employersponsored group disability policy was issued in 1911before the development of medical expense insurance patients were expected to pay health care costs out of their own pockets under what is known as the feeforservice business model during the middletolate 20th century traditional disability insurance evolved into modern health insurance programs one major obstacle to this development was that early forms of comprehensive health insurance were enjoined by courts for violating the traditional ban on corporate practice of the professions by forprofit corporations state legislatures had to intervene and expressly legalize health insurance as an exception to that traditional rule today most comprehensive private health insurance programs cover the cost of routine preventive and emergency health care procedures and most prescription drugs but this is not always the casehospital and medical expense policies were introduced during the first half of the 20th century during the 1920s individual hospitals began offering services to individuals on a prepaid basis eventually leading to the development of blue

through the managed care entity providing the subscription health plan this determination may be made either prior to or after hospital admission concurrent utilization reviewthere are different options available to both employers and employees there are different types of plans including health savings accounts and plans with a high or low deductible the plans that have the high deductibles typically cost the employee less for the monthly premiums but the part they pay for each time they use their insurance as well as the overall deductible before the insurance covers anything is much higher these types of plans are good for the people who rarely go to the doctor and need little health care the lower deductible plans are typically more expensive however they save the employee from having to spend a lot of money out of pocket for services and treatment the recent trend for employers is to offer the high deductible plans called consumerdriven healthcare plans because it costs them less overall for the care their employees need but it is a lower monthly premium for the employees comprehensive vs scheduled comprehensive health insurance pays a percentage of the cost of hospital and physician charges after a deductible
usually applies to hospital charges or a copay usually applies to physician charges but may apply to some hospital services is met by the insured these plans are generally expensive because of the high potential benefit payout  1000000 to 5000000 is common  and because of the vast array of covered benefitsscheduled health insurance plans are not meant to replace a traditional comprehensive health insurance plans and are more of a basic policy providing access to daytoday health care such as going to the doctor or getting a prescription drug in recent years these plans have taken the name minimed plans or association plans the term association is often used to describe them because they require membership in an association that must exist for some other purpose than to sell insurance examples include the health care credit union association these plans may provide benefits for hospitalization and surgical but these benefits will be limited scheduled plans are not meant to be effective for catastrophic events these plans cost much less than comprehensive health insurance they generally pay limited benefits amounts directly to the service provider and payments are based upon the plans schedule of benefits as of 2005 annual
benefit maxima for a typical mini scheduled health insurance plan may range from 1000 to 25000 factors affecting insurance prices a recent study by pricewaterhousecoopers examining the drivers of rising health care costs in the us pointed to increased utilization created by increased consumer demand new treatments and more intensive diagnostic testing as the most significant however wendell potter a longtime pr representative for the health insurance industry has noted that the group which sponsored this study ahip is a frontgroup funded by various insurance companies people in developed countries are living longer the population of those countries is aging and a larger group of senior citizens requires more intensive medical care than a young healthier population advances in medicine and medical technology can also increase the cost of medical treatment lifestylerelated factors can increase utilization and therefore insurance prices such as increases in obesity caused by insufficient exercise and unhealthy food choices excessive alcohol use smoking and use of street drugs other factors noted by the pwc study included the movement to broaderaccess plans higherpriced technologies and costshifting from medicaid and the uninsured to private payersother researchers note that doctors and other healthcare providers are rewarded for merely treating
patients rather than curing them and that patients insured through employer group policies have incentives to go to the absolute best hcps rather than the most costeffective ones military the price of health insurance for retired and active duty military personnel has gone up from 19 billion a decade ago to 52 billion in 2012 tricare the government veterans health insurance program makes up nine percent of the total budget for the department of defense california in 2007 87 of californians had some form of health insurance services in california range from private offerings hmos ppos to public programs medical medicare and healthy families schipcalifornia developed a solution to assist people across the state and is one of the few states to have an office devoted to giving people tips and resources to get the best care possible californias office of the patient advocate was established july 2000 to publish a yearly health care quality report card on the top hmos ppos and medical groups and to create and distribute helpful tips and resources to give californians the tools needed to get the best careadditionally california has a help center that assists californians when they have problems with their health

a primary care physician such as a general practitioner or family physician another professional would be a licensed independent practitioner such as a physiotherapist or a nonphysician primary care provider such as a physician assistant or nurse practitioner depending on the locality health system organization the patient may see another health care professional first such as a pharmacist or nurse depending on the nature of the health condition patients may be referred for secondary or tertiary careprimary care is often used as the term for the health care services that play a role in the local community it can be provided in different settings such as urgent care centers which provide same day appointments or services on a walkin basisprimary care involves the widest scope of health care including all ages of patients patients of all socioeconomic and geographic origins patients seeking to maintain optimal health and patients with all types of acute and chronic physical mental and social health issues including multiple chronic diseases consequently a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas continuity is a key characteristic of primary care as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine checkups
and preventive care health education and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem the international classification of primary care icpc is a standardized tool for understanding and analyzing information on interventions in primary care based on the reason for the patients visitcommon chronic illnesses usually treated in primary care may include for example hypertension diabetes asthma copd depression and anxiety back pain arthritis or thyroid dysfunction primary care also includes many basic maternal and child health care services such as family planning services and vaccinations in the united states the 2013 national health interview survey found that skin disorders 427 osteoarthritis and joint disorders 336 back problems 239 disorders of lipid metabolism 224 and upper respiratory tract disease 221 excluding asthma were the most common reasons for accessing a physicianin the united states primary care physicians have begun to deliver primary care outside of the managed care insurancebilling system through direct primary care which is a subset of the more familiar concierge medicine physicians in this model bill patients directly for services either on a prepaid monthly quarterly or annual basis or bill for each service in the office examples of direct primary care practices

united states which operates under a mixed market health care system some physicians might voluntarily limit their practice to secondary care by requiring patients to see a primary care provider first this restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group health insurance plans in other cases medical specialists may see patients without a referral and patients may decide whether selfreferral is preferredin the united kingdom and canada patient selfreferral to a medical specialist for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician either a primary care physician or another specialist is considered necessary regardless of whether the funding is from private insurance schemes or national health insuranceallied health professionals such as physical therapists respiratory therapists occupational therapists speech therapists and dietitians also generally work in secondary care accessed through either patient selfreferral or through physician referral tertiary care tertiary care is specialized consultative health care usually for inpatients and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced medical investigation and treatment such as a tertiary referral hospitalexamples of tertiary care services are cancer management neurosurgery cardiac surgery plastic surgery treatment
for severe burns advanced neonatology services palliative and other complex medical and surgical interventions quaternary care the term quaternary care is sometimes used as an extension of tertiary care in reference to advanced levels of medicine which are highly specialized and not widely accessed experimental medicine and some types of uncommon diagnostic or surgical procedures are considered quaternary care these services are usually only offered in a limited number of regional or national health care centers quaternary care is more prevalent in the united kingdom home and community care many types of health care interventions are delivered outside of health facilities they include many interventions of public health interest such as food safety surveillance distribution of condoms and needleexchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseasesthey also include the services of professionals in residential and community settings in support of self care home care longterm care assisted living treatment for substance use disorders among other types of health and social care servicescommunity rehabilitation services can assist with mobility and independence after loss of limbs or loss of function this can include prosthesis orthotics or wheelchairsmany countries especially in the west are dealing with aging populations so one of the priorities
of the health care system is to help seniors live full independent lives in the comfort of their own homes there is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in daytoday activities at home such as transportation to and from doctors appointments along with many other activities that are essential for their health and wellbeing although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation family members and care workers may harbor diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts this state of affairs presents a challenge for the design of ict information and communication technology for home carebecause statistics show that over 80 million americans have taken time off of their primary employment to care for a loved one many countries have begun offering programs such as consumer directed personal assistant program to allow family members to take care of their loved ones without giving up their entire incomewith obesity in children rapidly becoming a major concern health services often set up programs in schools aimed at educating children about nutritional eating habits making physical education a requirement and teaching young adolescents to have positive selfimage ratings health care ratings are ratings or evaluations

and equitable delivery of health care interventions as advanced through the social model of health and disability which emphasizes the societal changes that can be made to make populations healthier results from health services research often form the basis of evidencebased policy in health care systems health services research is also aided by initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence for the development of systems of health assessment that are clinically useful timely sensitive to change culturally sensitive low burden low cost built into standard procedures and involve the patient health care financing there are generally five primary methods of funding health care systemsgeneral taxation to the state county or municipalitysocial health insurancevoluntary or private health insuranceoutofpocket paymentsdonations to health charitiesin most countries the financing of health care services features a mix of all five models but the exact distribution varies across countries and over time within countries in all countries and jurisdictions there are many topics in the politics and evidence that can influence the decision of a government private sector business or other groups to adopt a specific health policy regarding the financing structurefor example social health insurance is where a nations entire population is eligible for health

for processing by a claims adjuster the insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk especially if the risk is too large for the primary insurer to carry history  early methods methods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced by chinese and babylonian traders as long ago as the 3rd and 2nd millennia bc respectively chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessels capsizing the babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous code of hammurabi c 1750 bc and practiced by early mediterranean sailing merchants if a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lenders guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen or lost at seacirca 800 bc the inhabitants of rhodes created the general average this allowed groups of merchants to pay to insure their goods being shipped together the collected premiums would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during transport whether to storm or sinkageseparate insurance contracts
ie insurance policies not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts were invented in genoa in the 14th century as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates the first known insurance contract dates from genoa in 1347 and in the next century maritime insurance developed widely and premiums were intuitively varied with risks these new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment a separation of roles that first proved useful in marine insurance modern insurance insurance became far more sophisticated in enlightenment era europe and specialized varieties developedproperty insurance as we know it today can be traced to the great fire of london which in 1666 devoured more than 13000 houses the devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance from a matter of convenience into one of urgency a change of opinion reflected in sir christopher wrens inclusion of a site for the insurance office in his new plan for london in 1667 a number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing but in 1681 economist nicholas barbon and eleven associates established the first fire insurance company the insurance office for houses at the back of the royal exchange to insure
brick and frame homes initially 5000 homes were insured by his insurance officeat the same time the first insurance schemes for the underwriting of business ventures became available by the end of the seventeenth century londons growing importance as a center for trade was increasing demand for marine insurance in the late 1680s edward lloyd opened a coffee house which became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships and those willing to underwrite such ventures these informal beginnings led to the establishment of the insurance market lloyds of london and several related shipping and insurance businessesthe first life insurance policies were taken out in the early 18th century the first company to offer life insurance was the amicable society for a perpetual assurance office founded in london in 1706 by william talbot and sir thomas allen edward rowe mores established the society for equitable assurances on lives and survivorship in 1762it was the worlds first mutual insurer and it pioneered age based premiums based on mortality rate laying the framework for scientific insurance practice and development and the basis of modern life assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently basedin
the late 19th century accident insurance began to become available the first company to offer accident insurance was the railway passengers assurance company formed in 1848 in england to insure against the rising number of fatalities on the nascent railway systemby the late 19th century governments began to initiate national insurance programs against sickness and old age germany built on a tradition of welfare programs in prussia and saxony that began as early as in the 1840s in the 1880s chancellor otto von bismarck introduced old age pensions accident insurance and medical care that formed the basis for germanys welfare state in britain more extensive legislation was introduced by the liberal government in the 1911 national insurance act this gave the british working classes the first contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment this system was greatly expanded after the second world war under the influence of the beveridge report to form the first modern welfare state principles insurance involves pooling funds from many insured entities known as exposures to pay for the losses that some may incur the insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity
of the event occurring in order to be an insurable risk the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics insurance as a financial intermediary is a commercial enterprise and a major part of the financial services industry but individual entities can also selfinsure through saving money for possible future losses insurability risk which can be insured by private companies typically shares seven common characteristicslarge number of similar exposure units since insurance operates through pooling resources the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes allowing insurers to benefit from the law of large numbers in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses exceptions include lloyds of london which is famous for insuring the life or health of actors sports figures and other famous individuals however all exposures will have particular differences which may lead to different premium ratesdefinite loss the loss takes place at a known time in a known place and from a known cause the classic example is death of an insured person on a life insurance policy fire automobile accidents and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion other types of losses may only be definite in theory occupational disease
for instance may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time place or cause is identifiable ideally the time place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person with sufficient information could objectively verify all three elementsaccidental loss the event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance the loss should be pure in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost events that contain speculative elements such as ordinary business risks or even purchasing a lottery ticket are generally not considered insurablelarge loss the size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy adjusting losses and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims for small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses there is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real
value to a buyeraffordable premium if the likelihood of an insured event is so high or the cost of the event so large that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered then it is not likely that the insurance will be purchased even if on offer furthermore as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer if there is no such chance of loss then the transaction may have the form of insurance but not the substance see the us financial accounting standards board pronouncement number 113 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of shortduration and longduration contractscalculable loss there are two elements that must be at least estimable if not formally calculable the probability of loss and the attendant cost probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount
of the loss recoverable as a result of the claimlimited risk of catastrophically large losses insurable losses are ideally independent and noncatastrophic meaning that the losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base capital constrains insurers ability to sell earthquake insurance as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones in the united states flood risk is insured by the federal government in commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurers capital constraint such properties are generally shared among several insurers or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the reinsurance market legal when a company insures an individual entity there are basic legal requirements and regulations several commonly cited legal principles of insurance includeindemnity  the insurance company indemnifies or compensates the insured in the case of certain losses only up to the insureds interestbenefit insurance  as it is stated in the study books of the chartered insurance institute
the insurance company does not have the right of recovery from the party who caused the injury and is to compensate the insured regardless of the fact that insured had already sued the negligent party for the damages for example personal accident insuranceinsurable interest  the insured typically must directly suffer from the loss insurable interest must exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved the concept requires that the insured have a stake in the loss or damage to the life or property insured what that stake is will be determined by the kind of insurance involved and the nature of the property ownership or relationship between the persons the requirement of an insurable interest is what distinguishes insurance from gamblingutmost good faith  uberrima fides the insured and the insurer are bound by a good faith bond of honesty and fairness material facts must be disclosedcontribution  insurers which have similar obligations to the insured contribute in the indemnification according to some methodsubrogation  the insurance company acquires legal rights to pursue recoveries on behalf of the insured for example the insurer may sue those liable for the insureds loss the insurers can waive their
subrogation rights by using the special clausescausa proxima or proximate cause  the cause of loss the peril must be covered under the insuring agreement of the policy and the dominant cause must not be excludedmitigation  in case of any loss or casualty the asset owner must attempt to keep loss to a minimum as if the asset was not insured indemnification to indemnify means to make whole again or to be reinstated to the position that one was in to the extent possible prior to the happening of a specified event or peril accordingly life insurance is generally not considered to be indemnity insurance but rather contingent insurance ie a claim arises on the occurrence of a specified event there are generally three types of insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insureda reimbursement policya pay on behalf or on behalf of policyan indemnification policyfrom an insureds standpoint the result is usually the same the insurer pays the loss and claims expensesif the insured has a reimbursement policy the insured can be required to pay for a loss and then be reimbursed by the insurance carrier for the loss and out of pocket costs including with the permission
of the insurer claim expensesunder a pay on behalf policy the insurance carrier would defend and pay a claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of pay on behalf language which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claimunder an indemnification policy the insurance carrier can generally either reimburse or pay on behalf of whichever is more beneficial to it and the insured in the claim handling processan entity seeking to transfer risk an individual corporation or association of any type etc becomes the insured party once risk is assumed by an insurer the insuring party by means of a contract called an insurance policy generally an insurance contract includes at a minimum the following elements identification of participating parties the insurer the insured the beneficiaries the premium the period of coverage the particular loss event covered the amount of coverage ie the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss and exclusions events not covered an insured is thus said to be indemnified against the loss covered in the policywhen insured parties experience
a loss for a specified peril the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy the fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims  in theory for a relatively few claimants  and for overhead costs so long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses called reserves the remaining margin is an insurers profit social effects insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage on one hand it can increase fraud on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societiesinsurance can influence the probability of losses through moral hazard insurance fraud and preventive steps by the insurance company insurance scholars have typically used moral hazard to refer to the increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference insurers
attempt to address carelessness through inspections policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts while in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measuresparticularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanesbecause of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles however since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active role in loss mitigation such as through building codes methods of insurance according to the study books of the chartered insurance institute there are variant methods of insurance as followscoinsurance  risks shared between insurersdual insurance  having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk both the individual policies would not pay separately  under a concept named contribution they would contribute together to make up the policyholders losses however in case of contingency insurances such as life insurance dual payment is allowedselfinsurance  situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities or individuals themselvesreinsurance  situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another insurer called the reinsurer insurers business model 
underwriting and investing the business model is to collect more in premium and investment income than is paid out in losses and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will accept profit can be reduced to a simple equationprofit  earned premium  investment income  incurred loss  underwriting expensesinsurers make money in two waysthrough underwriting the process by which insurers select the risks to insure and decide how much in premiums to charge for accepting those risksby investing the premiums they collect from insured partiesthe most complicated aspect of the insurance business is the actuarial science of ratemaking pricesetting of policies which uses statistics and probability to approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk after producing rates the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting processat the most basic level initial ratemaking involves looking at the frequency and severity of insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss data bring the loss data to present value and compare these prior losses to the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy loss ratios and expense loads are
also used rating for different risk characteristics involves at the most basic level comparing the losses with loss relativitiesa policy with twice as many losses would therefore be charged twice as much more complex multivariate analyses are sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results other statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future lossesupon termination of a given policy the amount of premium collected minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurers underwriting profit on that policy underwriting performance is measured by something called the combined ratio which is the ratio of expenseslosses to premiums a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit while anything over 100 indicates an underwriting loss a company with a combined ratio over 100 may nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earningsinsurance companies earn investment profits on float float or available reserve is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest or other income on them
until claims are paid out the association of british insurers gathering 400 insurance companies and 94 of uk insurance services has almost 20 of the investments in the london stock exchangein the united states the underwriting loss of property and casualty insurance companies was 1423 billion in the five years ending 2003 but overall profit for the same period was 684 billion as the result of float some insurance industry insiders most notably hank greenberg do not believe that it is forever possible to sustain a profit from float without an underwriting profit as well but this opinion is not universally heldnaturally the float method is difficult to carry out in an economically depressed period bear markets do cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards so a poor economy generally means high insurance premiums this tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known as the underwriting or insurance cycle claims claims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance it is the actual product paid for claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or through brokers or agents the insurer may require that the
claim be filed on its own proprietary forms or may accept claims on a standard industry form such as those produced by acordinsurance company claims departments employ a large number of claims adjusters supported by a staff of records management and data entry clerks incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience the adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim usually in close cooperation with the insured determines if coverage is available under the terms of the insurance contract and if so the reasonable monetary value of the claim and authorizes paymentthe policyholder may hire their own public adjuster to negotiate the settlement with the insurance company on their behalf for policies that are complicated where claims may be complex the insured may take out a separate insurance policy addon called loss recovery insurance which covers the cost of a public adjuster in the case of a claimadjusting liability insurance claims is particularly difficult because there is a third party involved the plaintiff who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as a deep pocket the adjuster
must obtain legal counsel for the insured either inside house counsel or outside panel counsel monitor litigation that may take years to complete and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement conference when requested by the judgeif a claims adjuster suspects underinsurance the condition of average may come into play to limit the insurance companys exposurein managing the claims handling function insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction administrative handling expenses and claims overpayment leakages as part of this balancing act fraudulent insurance practices are a major business risk that must be managed and overcome disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation see insurance bad faith marketing insurers will often use insurance agents to initially market or underwrite their customers agents can be captive meaning they write only for one company or independent meaning that they can issue policies from several companies the existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to improved and personalized service companies also use broking firms banks and other corporate entities like self help groups microfinance institutions ngos etc to market their

state insurance insulates too much an insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as riskaverse as they might otherwise be since by definition the insured has transferred the risk to the insurer a concept known as moral hazard this insulates many from the true costs of living with risk negating measures that can mitigate or adapt to risk and leading some to describe insurance schemes as potentially maladaptive to reduce their own financial exposure insurance companies have contractual clauses that mitigate their obligation to provide coverage if the insured engages in behavior that grossly magnifies their risk of loss or liabilityfor example life insurance companies may require higher premiums or deny coverage altogether to people who work in hazardous occupations or engage in dangerous sports liability insurance providers do not provide coverage for liability arising from intentional torts committed by or at the direction of the insured even if a provider desired to provide such coverage it is against the public policy of most countries to allow such insurance to exist and thus it is usually illegal complexity of insurance policy contracts insurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees
and coverages included in a policy as a result people may buy policies on unfavorable terms in response to these issues many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may be advertised and soldfor example most insurance policies in the english language today have been carefully drafted in plain english the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying typically courts construe ambiguities in insurance policies against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policymany institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker while on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer not the insurance company and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations in the vast majority of cases a brokers compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium creating a conflict of interest in that the brokers financial interest is tilted towards encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher
price a broker generally holds contracts with many insurers thereby allowing the broker to shop the market for the best rates and coverage possibleinsurance may also be purchased through an agent a tied agent working exclusively with one insurer represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker an agent has a different type of conflict because agents work directly for the insurance company if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance brokeran independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a feeforservice retainer similar to an attorney and thus offers completely independent advice free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers or agents however such a consultant must still work through brokers or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients limited consumer benefits in the united states economists and consumer advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for lowprobability catastrophic losses but not for highprobability small losses because of this consumers are
advised to select high deductibles and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life however consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively highprobability small losses over lowprobability perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the lowprobability risk this is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against lowprobability losses and may result in increased inefficiencies from moral hazard redlining redlining is the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination racial profiling or redlining has a long history in the property insurance industry in the united states from a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials court documents and research by government agencies industry and community groups and academics it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industryin july 2007 the federal trade commission ftc released a report presenting the results of a study concerning creditbased insurance scores in automobile insurance the study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk it also showed that africanamericans and hispanics are substantially
overrepresented in the lowest credit scores and substantially underrepresented in the highest while caucasians and asians are more evenly spread across the scores the credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups leading the ftc to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining the ftc indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers the report was disputed by representatives of the consumer federation of america the national fair housing alliance the national consumer law center and the center for economic justice for relying on data provided by the insurance industryall states have provisions in their rate regulation laws or in their fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination often called redlining in setting rates and making insurance availablein determining premiums and premium rate structures insurers consider quantifiable factors including location credit scores gender occupation marital status and education level however the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully discriminatory and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors usedan
insurance underwriters job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate this basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent thus discrimination against ie negative differential treatment of potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premiumsetting process is a necessary byproduct of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting for instance insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance older people are thus treated differently from younger people ie a distinction is made discrimination occurs the rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes old people are likely to die sooner than young people so the risk of loss the insureds death is greater in any given period of time and therefore the risk premium must be higher to cover the greater risk however treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination insurance patents new assurance products can now be protected from copying with a business method patent in

while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax religious concerns muslim scholars have varying opinions about life insurance life insurance policies that earn interest or guaranteed bonusnav are generally considered to be a form of riba usury and some consider even policies that do not earn interest to be a form of gharar speculation some argue that gharar is not present due to the actuarial science behind the underwriting jewish rabbinical scholars also have expressed reservations regarding insurance as an avoidance of gods will but most find it acceptable in moderationsome christians believe insurance represents a lack of faith and there is a long history of resistance to commercial insurance in anabaptist communities mennonites amish hutterites brethren in christ but many participate in communitybased selfinsurance programs that spread risk within their communities see also countryspecific articlesinsurance in australiainsurance in indiainsurance in the united statesinsurance in the united kingdom notes  bibliography dickson p g m 1960 the sun insurance office 17101960 the history of two and a half centuries of british insurance london oxford university press p 324  external links congressional research service crs reports regarding the us insurance industryfederation of european risk management associationsinsurance at curlie

make efforts to deter such activitiesan epigram by the roman poet martial provides a clear evidence the phenomenon of insurance fraud was already known in the roman empire during the first century ad tongilianus you paid two hundred for your housean accident too common in this city destroyed ityou collected ten times more doesnt it seem i praythat you set fire to your own house tongilianusbook iii no 52 causes the chief motive in all insurance crimes is financial profit insurance contracts provide both the insured and the insurer with opportunities for exploitationaccording to the coalition against insurance fraud the causes vary but are usually centered on greed and on holes in the protections against fraud often those who commit insurance fraud view it as a lowrisk lucrative enterprise for example drug dealers who have entered insurance fraud  think its safer and more profitable than working street corners compared to those for other crimes court sentences for insurance fraud can be lenient reducing the risk of extended punishment though insurers try to fight fraud some will pay suspicious claims anyway settling such claims is often cheaper than legal actionanother reason for fraud is overinsurance when the amount insured is
greater than the actual value of the property insured this condition can be very difficult to avoid especially since an insurance provider might sometimes encourage it in order to obtain greater profits this allows fraudsters to make profits by destroying their property because the payment they receive from their insurers is of greater value than the property they destroy the most common forms of insurance fraud are reframing a noninsured damage in order to make it an event covered by insurance and inflating the value of the lossinsurance companies are also susceptible to fraud because its possible for fraudsters to file claims for damages that never occurred losses due to insurance fraud it is hard to place an exact value on the money stolen through insurance fraud insurance fraud is deliberately undetectable unlike visible crimes such as robbery or murder as such the number of cases of insurance fraud that are detected is much lower than the number of acts that are actually committed the best that can be done is to provide an estimate for the losses that insurers suffer due to insurance fraud the coalition against insurance fraud estimates that in 2006 a total of about 80 billion
was lost in the united states due to insurance fraud according to estimates by the insurance information institute insurance fraud accounts for about 10 percent of the propertycasualty insurance industrys incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses the national health care antifraud association estimates that 3 of the health care industrys expenditures in the united states are due to fraudulent activities amounting to a cost of about 51 billion other estimates attribute as much as 10 of the total healthcare spending in the united states to fraudabout 115 billion annually another study of all types of fraud committed in the united states insurance institutions propertyandcasualty business liability healthcare social security etcput the true cost at 33 to 38 of the total cash flow through the system this study resulted in the book title the trillion dollar insurance crook by je smith in the united kingdom the insurance fraud bureau estimates that the loss due to insurance fraud in the united kingdom is about 15 billion 308 billion causing a 5 increase in insurance premiums the insurance bureau of canada estimates that personal injury fraud in canada costs about c500 million annually indiaforensic center of studies estimates that insurance frauds in india
costs about 625 billion annually hard vs soft fraud insurance fraud can be classified as either hard fraud or soft fraudhard fraud occurs when someone deliberately plans or invents a loss such as a collision auto theft or fire that is covered by their insurance policy in order to receive payment for damages criminal rings are sometimes involved in hard fraud schemes that can steal millions of dollarssoft fraud which is far more common than hard fraud is sometimes also referred to as opportunistic fraud this type of fraud consists of policyholders exaggerating otherwiselegitimate claims for example when involved in an automotive collision an insured person might claim more damage than actually occurred soft fraud can also occur when while obtaining a new health insurance policy an individual misreports previous or existing conditions in order to obtain a lower premium on his or her insurance policy types of insurance fraud  life insurance life insurance fraud may involve faking death to claim life insurance fraudsters may sometimes turn up a few years after disappearing claiming a loss of memoryan example of life insurance fraud is the john darwin disappearance case which was an investigation into the act of pseudocide committed
by the british former teacher and prison officer john darwin who turned up alive in december 2007 five years after he was thought to have died in a canoeing accident darwin was reported as missing after failing to report to work following a canoeing trip on march 21 2002 he reappeared on december 1 2007 claiming to have no memory of the past five yearsanother example is former british government minister john stonehouse who went missing in 1974 from a beach in miami he was discovered living under an assumed name in australia extradited to britain and jailed for seven years for fraud theft and forgery health care insurance health insurance fraud is described as an intentional act of deceiving concealing or misrepresenting information that results in health care benefits being paid to an individual or groupfraud can be committed either by an insured person or by a provider member fraud consists of claims on behalf of ineligible members andor dependents alterations on enrollment forms concealing preexisting conditions failure to report other coverage prescription drug fraud and failure to disclose claims that were a result of a workrelated injuryprovider fraud consists of claims submitted by bogus physicians billing for services
not rendered billing for higher level of services diagnosis or treatments that are outside the scope of practice alterations on claims submissions and providing services while medical licenses are either suspended or revoked independent medical examinations debunk false insurance claims and allow the insurance company or claimant to seek a nonpartial medical view for injuryrelated casesaccording to the coalition against insurance fraud health insurance fraud depletes taxpayerfunded programs like medicare and may victimize patients in the hands of certain doctors some scams involve doublebilling by doctors who charge insurers for treatments that never occurred and surgeons who perform unnecessary surgeryaccording to roger feldman blue cross professor of health insurance at the university of minnesota one of the main reasons that medical fraud is such a prevalent practice is that nearly all of the parties involved find it favorable in some way many physicians see it as necessary to provide quality care for their patients many patients although disapproving of the idea of fraud are sometimes more willing to accept it when it affects their own medical care program administrators are often lenient on the issue of insurance fraud as they want to maximize the services of their providersthe most common
perpetrators of healthcare insurance fraud are health care providers one reason for this according to david hyman a professor at the university of maryland school of law is that the historicallyprevailing attitude in the medical profession is one of fidelity to patients this incentive can lead to fraudulent practices such as billing insurers for treatments that are not covered by the patients insurance policy to do this physicians often bill for a different service which is covered by the policy rather than that which they renderedanother motivation for insurance fraud is a desire for financial gain public healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid are especially conducive to fraudulent activities as they are often run on a feeforservice structure physicians use several fraudulent techniques to achieve this end these can include upcoding or upgrading which involve billing for more expensive treatments than those actually provided providing and subsequently billing for treatments that are not medically necessary scheduling extra visits for patients referring patients to other physicians when no further treatment is actually necessary phantom billing or billing for services not rendered and ganging or billing for services to family members or other individuals who are accompanying the patient but who
did not personally receive any servicesperhaps the greatest total dollar amount of fraud is committed by the health insurance companies themselves there are numerous studies and articles detailing examples of insurance companies intentionally not paying claims and deleting them from their systems denying and cancelling coverage and the blatant underpayment to hospitals and physicians beneath what are normal fees for care they provide although difficult to obtain the information this fraud by insurance companies can be estimated by comparing revenues from premium payments and expenditures on health claimsin response to the increased amount of health care fraud in the united states congress through the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa has specifically established health care fraud as a federal criminal offense with punishment of up to ten years of prison in addition to significant financial penalties automobile insurance fraud rings or groups may fake traffic deaths or stage collisions to make false insurance or exaggerated claims and collect insurance money the ring may involve insurance claims adjusters and other people who create phony police reports to process claimsthe insurance fraud bureau in the uk estimated there have already been more than 20000 staged collisions and false insurance
claims across the uk from 1999 to 2006 one tactic fraudsters use is to drive to a busy junction or roundabout and brake sharply causing a motorist to drive into the back of them they claim the other motorist was at fault because they were driving too fast or too close behind them and make a false and inflated claim to the motorists insurer for whiplash and damage which can give the fraudsters up to 30000 in the insurance fraud bureaus first year or operation the usage of data mining initiatives exposed insurance fraud networks and led to 74 arrests and a fivetoone return on investmentthe insurance research council estimated that in 1996 21 to 36 percent of autoinsurance claims contained elements of suspected fraud there is a wide variety of schemes used to defraud automobile insurance providers these ploys can differ greatly in complexity and severity richard a derrig vice president of research for the insurance fraud bureau of massachusetts lists several ways that autoinsurance fraud can occur such as staged collisions in staged collision fraud fraudsters use a motor vehicle to stage an accident with the innocent party typically the fraudsters vehicle carries four or five passengers its
driver makes an unexpected manoeuvre forcing an innocent party to collide with the fraudsters vehicle each of the fraudsters then files claims for injuries sustained in the vehicle a recruited doctor diagnoses whiplash or other softtissue injuries which are hard to dispute laterother examples include jumping in front of cars as done in russia the driving conditions and roads are dangerous with many people trying to scam drivers by jumping in front of expensivelooking cars or crashing into them hit and runs are very common and insurance companies notoriously specialize in denying claims twoway insurance coverage is very expensive and almost completely unavailable for vehicles over ten years oldthe drivers can only obtain basic liability because russian courts do not like using verbal claims most people have dashboard cameras installed to warn wouldbe perpetrators or provide evidence foragainst claims exaggerated claims a real accident may occur but the dishonest owner may take the opportunity to incorporate a whole range of previous minor damage to the vehicle into the garage bill associated with the real accident personal injuries may also be exaggerated particularly whiplash insurance fraud cases of exaggerated claims can also include claiming damage to the car that did not
result from the accident for which the claim is made examples examples of soft autoinsurance fraud can include filing more than one claim for a single injury filing claims for injuries not related to an automobile accident misreporting wage losses due to injuries or reporting higher costs for car repairs than those that were actually paid hard autoinsurance fraud can include activities such as staging automobile collisions filing claims when the claimant was not actually involved in the accident submitting claims for medical treatments that were not received or inventing injuries hard fraud can also occur when claimants falsely report their vehicle as stolen soft fraud accounts for the majority of fraudulent autoinsurance claimsanother example is that a person may illegally register their car to a location that would net them cheaper insurance rates than where they actually live sometimes called rate evasion for example some drivers in brooklyn drive with pennsylvania license plates because registering their car in a rural part of pennsylvania will cost a lot less than registering it in brooklyn another form of automobile insurance fraud known as fronting involves registering someone other than the real primary driver of a car as the primary driver of
the car for example parents might list themselves as the primary driver of their childrens vehicles to avoid young driver premiumscrash for cash scams may involve random unaware strangers set to appear as the perpetrators of the orchestrated crashes such techniques are the classic rearend shunt the driver in front suddenly slams on the brakes possibly with brake lights disabled the decoy rearend shunt when following one car another one pulls in front of it causing it to brake sharply then the first car drives off or the helpful wave shunt the driver is waved into a line of queuing traffic by the scammer who promptly crashes then denies wavingorganized crime rings can also be involved in autoinsurance fraud sometimes carrying out schemes that are very complex an example of one such ploy is given by ken dornstein author of accidentally on purpose the making of a personal injury underworld in america in this scheme known as a swoopandsquat one or more drivers in swoop cars force an unsuspecting driver into position behind a squat car this squat car which is usually filled with several passengers then slows abruptly forcing the driver of the chosen car to collide with the
squat car the passengers in the squat car then file a claim with the other drivers insurance company this claim often includes bills for medical treatments that were not necessary or not receivedan incident that took place on golden state freeway june 17 1992 brought public attention to the existence of organized crime rings that stage auto accidents for insurance fraud these schemes generally consist of three different levels at the top there are the professionalsdoctors or lawyers who diagnose false injuries andor file fraudulent claims and these earn the bulk of the profits from the fraud next are the capper insurance frauds or runners the middlemen who obtain the cars to crash farm out the claims to the professionals at the top and recruit participants these participants at the bottomrung of the scheme are desperate people poor immigrants or others in need of quick cash who are paid around 1000 usd to place their bodies in the paths of cars and trucks playing a kind of russian roulette with their lives and those of unsuspecting motorists around them according to investigators cappers usually hire within their own ethnic groups what makes busting these stagedaccident crime rings difficult is how
quickly they move into jurisdictions with lesser enforcement after a crackdown in a particular region as a result in the us several levels of police and the insurance industry have cooperated in forming task forces and sharing databases to track claim historiesin the united kingdom there is an increasing incidence of false whiplash claims to car insurance companies from motorists involved in minor car accidents for instance a shunt because the mechanism of injury is not fully understood ae doctors have to rely on a patients external symptoms which are easy to fake resultingly no win no fee personal injury solicitors exploit this loophole for easy compensation money often a 2500 payout ultimately this has resulted in increased motor insurance premiums which has had the knockon effect of pricing younger drivers off the road property insurance possible motivations for this can include obtaining payment that is worth more than the value of the property destroyed or to destroy and subsequently receive payment for goods that could not otherwise be sold according to alfred manes the majority of property insurance crimes involve arson one reason for this is that any evidence that a fire was started by arson is often destroyed
by the fire itself according to the united states fire administration in the united states there were approximately 31000 fires caused by arson in 2006 resulting in losses of 755 million council compensation claims the fraud involving claims from the councils insurers suppose staging damages blamable on the local authorities mostly falls and trips on council owned land or inflating the value of existing damages detecting insurance fraud the detection of insurance fraud generally occurs in two steps the first step is to identify suspicious claims that have a higher possibility of being fraudulent this can be done by computerized statistical analysis or by referrals from claims adjusters or insurance agents additionally the public can provide tips to insurance companies law enforcement and other organizations regarding suspected observed or admitted insurance fraud perpetrated by other individuals regardless of the source the next step is to refer these claims to investigators for further analysisdue to the sheer number of claims submitted each day it would be far too expensive for insurance companies to have employees check each claim for symptoms of fraud instead many companies use computers and statistical analysis to identify suspicious claims for further investigation there are two main
types of statistical analysis tools used supervised and unsupervised in both cases suspicious claims are identified by comparing data about the claim to expected values the main difference between the two methods is how the expected values are derivedin a supervised method expected values are obtained by analyzing records of both fraudulent and nonfraudulent claims according to richard j bolton and david b hand both of imperial college in london this method has some drawbacks as it requires absolute certainty that those claims analyzed are actually either fraudulent or nonfraudulent and because it can only be used to detect types of fraud that have been committed and identified beforeunsupervised methods of statistical detection on the other hand involve detecting claims that are abnormal both claims adjusters and computers can also be trained to identify red flags or symptoms that in the past have often been associated with fraudulent claims statistical detection does not prove that claims are fraudulent it merely identifies suspicious claims that need to be investigated furtherfraudulent claims can be one of two types they can be otherwise legitimate claims that are exaggerated or built up or they can be false claims in which the damages claimed never
actually occurred once a built up claim is identified insurance companies usually try to negotiate the claim down to the appropriate amount suspicious claims can also be submitted to special investigative units or sius for further investigation these units generally consist of experienced claims adjusters with special training in investigating fraudulent claims these investigators look for certain symptoms associated with fraudulent claims or otherwise look for evidence of falsification of some kind this evidence can then be used to deny payment of the claims or to prosecute fraudsters if the violation is serious enoughonce an insurance companys fraud investigation department is assigned to investigate a fraud claim they will frequently proceed with the investigation in two stages precontact and postcontact  the first precontact stage involves analyzing all available evidence before the suspect is contacted this may involve reviewing paperwork submitted reaching out to third parities and gathering evidence from available sources the second stage postcontact involves initiating contact with the suspect to gather more information and ideally obtain an incriminating statement insurance fraud investigators are trained to question the suspect in a manner that would preclude the possibility of the suspect raising a valid defense at a later time
for example questions about access to claim forms would preclude the defense that another individual filled out the fraudulent documents common defenses that may be precluded by the suspect interview include for example that the suspect lacked knowledge that his or her statement was false lacked the intention to defraud another individual or made an ambiguous statement that was later interpreted incorrectly full disclosure may add credibility to a suspects account of events but omissions from disclosure or false statements may detract from the suspects credibility in later interviews or proceedingsin the health insurance fraud context determining fraud committed by the health insurance companies can also sometimes be found by comparing revenues from premiums paid against the expenditure by the health insurance companies on claimsas an example in 2006 the harris county medical society in texas had a health insurance rate increase of 22 percent for consumerdriven health plan from blue cross and blue shield of texas this was despite the fact that during the previous year blue cross had paid out only 9 percent of the collected premium dollars for claims legislation national and local governments especially in the last half of the twentieth century have recognized insurance fraud
as a serious crime and have made efforts to punish and prevent this practice some major developments are listed below united states insurance fraud is specifically classified as a crime in all states though a minority of states only criminalize certain types eg oregon only outlaws worker compensation and property claim fraudthe coalition against insurance fraud was founded in 1993 to help fight insurance fraud this organization collects information on insurance fraud and is the only antifraud alliance speaking for consumers insurance companies government agencies and others through its unique work the coalition empowers consumers to fight back helps fraud fighters better detect this crime and deters more people from committing fraud the coalition supports this mission with a large and continually expanding armory of practical tools information research  data services and insight as a leading voice of the antifraud communityapproximately one third of these investigations result in criminal conviction one third result in denial of the claim and one third result in payment of the claim4819 states require mandatory insurer fraud plans this requires companies to form programs to combat fraud and in some cases to develop investigation units to detect fraud41 states have fraud bureaus these are

by regular or single premiums common forms in the us are whole life universal life and variable life policies history an early form of life insurance dates to ancient rome burial clubs covered the cost of members funeral expenses and assisted survivors financially the first company to offer life insurance in modern times was the amicable society for a perpetual assurance office founded in london in 1706 by william talbot and sir thomas allen each member made an annual payment per share on one to three shares with consideration to age of the members being twelve to fiftyfive at the end of the year a portion of the amicable contribution was divided among the wives and children of deceased members in proportion to the number of shares the heirs owned the amicable society started with 2000 membersthe first life table was written by edmund halley in 1693 but it was only in the 1750s that the necessary mathematical and statistical tools were in place for the development of modern life insurance james dodson a mathematician and actuary tried to establish a new company aimed at correctly offsetting the risks of long term life assurance policies after being refused admission to
the amicable life assurance society because of his advanced age he was unsuccessful in his attempts at procuring a charter from the governmenthis disciple edward rowe mores was able to establish the society for equitable assurances on lives and survivorship in 1762 it was the worlds first mutual insurer and it pioneered age based premiums based on mortality rate laying the framework for scientific insurance practice and development and the basis of modern life assurance upon which all life assurance schemes were subsequently basedmores also gave the name actuary to the chief officialthe earliest known reference to the position as a business concern the first modern actuary was william morgan who served from 1775 to 1830 in 1776 the society carried out the first actuarial valuation of liabilities and subsequently distributed the first reversionary bonus 1781 and interim bonus 1809 among its members it also used regular valuations to balance competing interests the society sought to treat its members equitably and the directors tried to ensure that policyholders received a fair return on their investments premiums were regulated according to age and anybody could be admitted regardless of their state of health and other circumstancesthe sale of life insurance in
the us began in the 1760s the presbyterian synods in philadelphia and new york city created the corporation for relief of poor and distressed widows and children of presbyterian ministers in 1759 episcopalian priests organized a similar fund in 1769 between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started but fewer than half a dozen survived in the 1870s military officers banded together to found both the army aafmaa and the navy mutual aid association navy mutual inspired by the plight of widows and orphans left stranded in the west after the battle of the little big horn and of the families of us sailors who died at sea overview  parties to contract the person responsible for making payments for a policy is the policy owner while the insured is the person whose death will trigger payment of the death benefit the owner and insured may or may not be the same person for example if joe buys a policy on his own life he is both the owner and the insured but if jane his wife buys a policy on joes life she is the owner and he is the insured the policy owner
is the guarantor and he will be the person to pay for the policy the insured is a participant in the contract but not necessarily a party to itthe beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured persons death the owner designates the beneficiary but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy the owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation if a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary any beneficiary changes policy assignments or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of the original beneficiaryin cases where the policy owner is not the insured also referred to as the celui qui vit or cqv insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an insurable interest in the cqv for life insurance policies close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest the insurable interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the cqv dies such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die with no insurable interest requirement the risk that a purchaser would murder the cqv
for insurance proceeds would be great in at least one case an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest who later murdered the cqv for the proceeds was found liable in court for contributing to the wrongful death of the victim liberty national life v weldon 267 ala171 1957 contract terms special exclusions may apply such as suicide clauses whereby the policy becomes null and void if the insured commits suicide within a specified time usually two years after the purchase date some states provide a statutory oneyear suicide clause any misrepresentations by the insured on the application may also be grounds for nullification most us states specify a maximum contestability period often no more than two years only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding whether to pay or deny the claimthe face amount of the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy matures although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face
amount the policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age such as 100 years old costs insurability and underwriting the insurance company calculates the policy prices premiums at a level sufficient to fund claims cover administrative costs and provide a profit the cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by actuaries mortality tables are statistically based tables showing expected annual mortality rates of people at different ages put simply people are more likely to die as they get older and the mortality tables enable the insurance companies to calculate the risk and increase premiums with age accordingly such estimates can be important in taxation regulationin the 1980s and 1990s the soa 197580 basic select  ultimate tables were the typical reference points while the 2001 vbt and 2001 cso tables were published more recently as well as the basic parameters of age and gender the newer tables include separate mortality tables for smokers and nonsmokers and the cso tables include separate tables for preferred classesthe mortality tables provide a baseline for the cost of insurance but the health and family history of the individual applicant is also taken into account except in the case of
group policies this investigation and resulting evaluation is termed underwriting health and lifestyle questions are asked with certain responses possibly meriting further investigation specific factors that may be considered by underwriters includepersonal medical historyfamily medical historydriving recordheight and weight matrix otherwise known as bmi body mass indexbased on the above and additional factors applicants will be placed into one of several classes of health ratings which will determine the premium paid in exchange for insurance at that particular carrierlife insurance companies in the united states support the medical information bureau mib which is a clearing house of information on persons who have applied for life insurance with participating companies in the last seven years as part of the application the insurer often requires the applicants permission to obtain information from their physiciansautomated life underwriting is a technology solution which is designed to perform all or some of the screening functions traditionally completed by underwriters and thus seeks to reduce the work effort time andor data necessary to underwrite a life insurance application these systems allow point of sale distribution and can shorten the time frame for issuance from weeks or even months to hours or minutes depending on the amount
of insurance being purchasedthe mortality of underwritten persons rises much more quickly than the general population at the end of 10 years the mortality of that 25yearold nonsmoking male is 0661000year consequently in a group of one thousand 25yearold males with a 100000 policy all of average health a life insurance company would have to collect approximately 50 a year from each participant to cover the relatively few expected claims 035 to 066 expected deaths in each year  100000 payout per death  35 per policy other costs such as administrative and sales expenses also need to be considered when setting the premiums a 10year policy for a 25yearold nonsmoking male with preferred medical history may get offers as low as 90 per year for a 100000 policy in the competitive us life insurance marketmost of the revenue received by insurance companies consists of premiums but revenue from investing the premiums forms an important source of profit for most life insurance companies group insurance policies are an exception to thisin the united states life insurance companies are never legally required to provide coverage to everyone with the exception of civil rights act compliance requirements insurance companies alone determine insurability
and some people are deemed uninsurable the policy can be declined or rated increasing the premium amount to compensate for the higher risk and the amount of the premium will be proportional to the face value of the policymany companies separate applicants into four general categories these categories are preferred best preferred standard and tobacco preferred best is reserved only for the healthiest individuals in the general population this may mean that the proposed insured has no adverse medical history is not under medication and has no family history of earlyonset cancer diabetes or other conditions preferred means that the proposed insured is currently under medication and has a family history of particular illnesses most people are in the standard categorypeople in the tobacco category typically have to pay higher premiums due to the higher mortality recent us mortality tables predict that roughly 035 in 1000 nonsmoking males aged 25 will die during the first year of a policy mortality approximately doubles for every extra ten years of age so the mortality rate in the first year for nonsmoking men is about 25 in 1000 people at age 65 compare this with the us population male mortality rates of 13
per 1000 at age 25 and 193 at age 65 without regard to health or smoking status death proceeds upon the insureds death the insurer requires acceptable proof of death before it pays the claim the normal minimum proof required is a death certificate and the insurers claim form completed signed and typically notarized if the insureds death is suspicious and the policy amount is large the insurer may investigate the circumstances surrounding the death before deciding whether it has an obligation to pay the claimpayment from the policy may be as a lump sum or as an annuity which is paid in regular installments for either a specified period or for the beneficiarys lifetime insurance vs assurance the specific uses of the terms insurance and assurance are sometimes confused in general in jurisdictions where both terms are used insurance refers to providing coverage for an event that might happen fire theft flood etc while assurance is the provision of coverage for an event that is certain to happen in the united states both forms of coverage are called insurance for reasons of simplicity in companies selling both products by some definitions insurance is any coverage that determines benefits based
on actual losses whereas assurance is coverage with predetermined benefits irrespective of the losses incurredlife insurance may be divided into two basic classes temporary and permanent or the following subclasses term universal whole life and endowment life insurance term insurance term assurance provides life insurance coverage for a specified term the policy does not accumulate cash value term insurance is significantly less expensive than an equivalent permanent policy but will become higher with age policy holders can save to provide for increased term premiums or decrease insurance needs by paying off debts or saving to provide for survivor needsmortgage life insurance insures a loan secured by real property and usually features a level premium amount for a declining policy face value because what is insured is the principal and interest outstanding on a mortgage that is constantly being reduced by mortgage payments the face amount of the policy is always the amount of the principal and interest outstanding that are paid should the applicant die before the final installment is paid group life insurance group life insurance also known as wholesale life insurance or institutional life insurance is term insurance covering a group of people usually employees of a company
members of a union or association or members of a pension or superannuation fund individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in its underwriting rather the underwriter considers the size turnover and financial strength of the group contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of adverse selection group life insurance often allows members exiting the group to maintain their coverage by buying individual coverage the underwriting is carried out for the whole group instead of individuals permanent life insurance permanent life insurance is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured a permanent insurance policy accumulates a cash value up to its date of maturation the owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money borrowing the cash value or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender valuethe three basic types of permanent insurance are whole life universal life and endowment whole life whole life insurance provides lifetime coverage for a set premium amount see main article for a full explanation of the many variations and options universal life coverage universal life insurance ull is a relatively new insurance product intended to combine permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payments
along with the potential for greater growth of cash values there are several types of universal life insurance policies including interestsensitive also known as traditional fixed universal life insurance variable universal life vul guaranteed death benefit and has equityindexed universal life insuranceuniversal life insurance policies have cash values paidin premiums increase their cash values administrative and other costs reduce their cash valuesuniversal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole lifenamely that premiums and death benefits are fixed with universal life both the premiums and death benefit are flexible with the exception of guaranteeddeathbenefit universal life policies universal life policies trade their greater flexibility off for fewer guaranteesflexible death benefit means the policy owner can choose to decrease the death benefit the death benefit can also be increased by the policy owner usually requiring new underwriting another feature of flexible death benefit is the ability to choose option a or option b death benefits and to change those options over the course of the life of the insured option a is often referred to as a level death benefit death benefits remain level for the life of the insured and premiums are lower than policies with option b death benefits
which pay the policys cash valueie a face amount plus earningsinterest if the cash value grows over time the death benefits do too if the cash value declines the death benefit also declines option b policies normally feature higher premiums than option a policies endowments the endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term on its maturity or on death typical maturities are ten fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit some policies also pay out in the case of critical illnesspolicies are typically traditional withprofits or unitlinked including those with unitized withprofits fundsendowments can be cashed in early or surrendered and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it accidental death accidental death insurance is a type of limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured should they die as the result of an accident accidents run the gamut from abrasions to catastrophes but normally do not include deaths resulting from nonaccidentrelated health problems or suicide because they only cover accidents these
policies are much less expensive than other life insurance policiessuch insurance can also be accidental death and dismemberment insurance or add in an add policy benefits are available not only for accidental death but also for the loss of limbs or body functions such as sight and hearingaccidental death and add policies very rarely pay a benefit either because the cause of death is not covered by the policy or because death occurs well after the accident by which time the premiums have gone unpaid to know what coverage they have insureds should always review their policies risky activities such as parachuting flying professional sports or military service are often omitted from coverageaccidental death insurance can also supplement standard life insurance as a rider if a rider is purchased the policy generally pays double the face amount if the insured dies from an accident this was once called double indemnity insurance in some cases triple indemnity coverage may be available senior and preneed products insurance companies have in recent years developed products for niche markets most notably targeting seniors in an aging population these are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies allowing senior citizens to purchase
affordable insurance later in life this may also be marketed as final expense insurance and usually have death benefits between 2000 and 40000 one reason for their popularity is that they only require answers to simple yes or no questions while most policies require a medical exam to qualify as with other policy types the range of premiums can vary widely and should be scrutinized prior to purchase as should the reliability of the companieshealth questions can vary substantially between exam and noexam policies it may be possible for individuals with certain conditions to qualify for one type of coverage and not another because seniors sometimes are not fully aware of the policy provisions it is important to make sure that policies last for a lifetime and that premiums do not increase every 5 years as is common in some circumstancespreneed life insurance policies are limited premium payment whole life policies that are usually purchased by older applicants though they are available to everyone this type of insurance is designed to cover specific funeral expenses that the applicant has designated in a contract with a funeral home the policys death benefit is initially based on the funeral cost at the
time of prearrangement and it then typically grows as interest is credited in exchange for the policy owners designation the funeral home typically guarantees that the proceeds will cover the cost of the funeral no matter when death occurs excess proceeds may go either to the insureds estate a designated beneficiary or the funeral home as set forth in the contract purchasers of these policies usually make a single premium payment at the time of prearrangement but some companies also allow premiums to be paid over as much as ten years related products riders are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued these riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner a common rider is accidental death see above another common rider is a premium waiver which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabledjoint life insurance is either term or permanent life insurance that insures two or more persons with proceeds payable on the death of either unit linked insurance plans these are unique insurance plans which are basically a mutual fund and term insurance plan rolled into one the investor doesnt participate in the profits

in these overall limits are insurance premiums this means that no additional deductible contributions can be made for the funding of insurance premiums insurance premiums can however be funded by undeducted contributions for further information on deductible contributions see under what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees and what is the definition of substantially selfemployed the insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15 tax on contributions and earnings ref itaa 1936 section 279 south africa premiums paid by a policyholder are not deductible from taxable income although premiums paid via an approved pension fund registered in terms of the income tax act are permitted to be deducted from personal income tax whether these premiums are nominally being paid by the employer or employee the benefits arising from life assurance policies are generally not taxable as income to beneficiaries again in the case of approved benefits these fall under retirement or withdrawal taxation rules from sars investment return within the policy will be taxed within the life policy and paid by the life assurer depending on the nature of
the policyholder whether natural person companyowned untaxed or a retirement fund united states premiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes and proceeds paid by the insurer upon the death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes however if the proceeds are included in the estate of the deceased it is likely they will be subject to federal and state estate and inheritance taxcash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur for this reason insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate tax shelter wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy in flexiblepremium policies large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a modified endowment contract by the internal revenue service irs which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance the insurance company in most cases will inform the policy owner of this danger before deciding their premiumthe tax ramifications of life insurance are complex the policy owner would be well advised to carefully consider them as always both the
united states congress and state legislatures can change the tax laws at any time united kingdom premiums are not usually deductible against income tax or corporation tax however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 march 1984 do still attract lapr life assurance premium relief at 15 with the net premium being collected from the policyholdernoninvestment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or capital gains tax on a claim if the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policyqualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria essentially long term contracts 10 years plus tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made all uk insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book this is deemed as meeting the lower rate 20 in 200506 of liability
for policyholders therefore a policyholder who is a higherrate taxpayer 40 in 200506 or becomes one through the transaction must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate this gain is reduced by applying a calculation called topslicing based on the number of years the policy has been held although this is complicated the taxation of life assurancebased investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equitybased collective investment schemes unit trusts investment trusts and oeics one feature which especially favors investment bonds is the 5 cumulative allowancethe ability to draw 5 of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn if not used in one year the 5 allowance can roll over into future years subject to a maximum taxdeferred withdrawal of 100 of the premiums payable the withdrawal is deemed by the hmrc her majestys revenue and customs to be a payment of capital and therefore the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy this is an especially useful tax planning tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in
the future as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being duethe proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for death duty in the uk inheritance tax purposes policies written in trust may fall outside the estate trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an independent financial adviser andor a solicitor pension term assurance although available before april 2006 from this date pension term assurance became widely available in the uk most uk insurers adopted the name life insurance with tax relief for the product pension term assurance is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums all premiums are paid at a net of basic rate tax at 22 and higherrate tax payers can gain an extra 18 tax relief via their tax return although not suitable for all pta briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the uk until chancellor gordon brown announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his prebudget announcement on 6 december 2006 stranger originated strangeroriginated life insurance or
stoli is a life insurance policy that is held or financed by a person who has no relationship to the insured person generally the purpose of life insurance is to provide peace of mind by assuring that financial loss or hardship will be alleviated in the event of the insured persons death stoli has often been used as an investment technique whereby investors will encourage someone usually an elderly person to purchase life insurance and name the investors as the beneficiary of the policy this undermines the primary purpose of life insurance as the investors would incur no financial loss should the insured person die in some jurisdictions there are laws to discourage or prevent stoli criticism although some aspects of the application process such as underwriting and insurable interest provisions make it difficult life insurance policies have been used to facilitate exploitation and fraud in the case of life insurance there is a possible motive to purchase a life insurance policy particularly if the face value is substantial and then murder the insured usually the larger the claim and the more serious the incident the larger and more intense the ensuing investigation consisting of police and insurer investigatorsthe television
series forensic files has included episodes that feature this scenario there was also a documented case in 2006 where two elderly women were accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them as part of their assistance they took out life insurance for the men after the contestability period ended on the policies the women are alleged to have had the men killed via hitandrun car crashesrecently viatical settlements have created problems for life insurance providers a viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder the policy holder sells the policy including the right to name the beneficiary to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value the seller has cash in hand and the purchaser will realize a profit when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser in the meantime the purchaser continues to pay the premiums although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement insurers are troubled by this trend insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death they also expect that a
certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies however viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out some purchasers in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased these policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers perspectiveon april 17 2016 a report by 60 minutes claimed that life insurance companies do not pay significant numbers of beneficiaries see also  references  specific references sourceskutty shashidharan 12 august 2008 managing life insurance phi learning pvt ltd isbn 9788120335318 oviatt f c economic place of insurance and its relation to society in american academy of political and social science national american woman suffrage association collection library of congress 1905 annals of the american academy of political and social science xxvi published by al hummel for the american academy of political and social science pp 181191 retrieved 8 june 2011 rothstein mark a 2004 genetics and life insurance medical underwriting and social policy mit press isbn 9780262182362  external links learn about life insurance  insurance information institute life insurance learning
